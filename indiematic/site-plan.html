			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose is to inform people of fun indie games people can try out, and encourage the creation of more games. Also allow people to compare reviews of different games.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My intended audience is people who are teens to young adults. Primarily want to attract people interested in video games and interested in trying new ones. People interested in indie games, or retro styled games.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Review button is present under each game, when pressed takes you to a page where you can leave a review. Review is listed under game after submitted.
                Search bar is present to search by title or genre.
                When review is submitted it records that review and score on the site, the review will stay as long as you are on the site.

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo - Logo will go on a darker background than here, but you can still slightly see it</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/3c3c3c-f9d400-000000-ffffff"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/3c3c3c-f9d400-000000-ffffff</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#3c3c3c]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#f9d400]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#000000]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#ffffff]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Top Rated</a>
				<a href="#">Sumbit Game</a>
			</nav>
			<hr />

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Welcome to Indie-matic! An indie gaming review site with insights into the best game right now</p>
			<h3>Top Rated</h3>
			<p>View the top rated games in the indie scene right now.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The red arrow wont be red, but will be a button to take the user to the listed games section. The image will be a slightly transparent image of general gaming imagery.
			</p>
			<img src="images/homewireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Top Rated</h3>
			<p>
				There will be many games listed in a row here, I might make each section and game image smaller so 2 or more fit on screen at once.
